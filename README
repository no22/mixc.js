This tiny Javascript dynamically mix CSS classes. (CSS Mixin)
You can make your own class by mixing classes of your favorite css framework. 
This script was inspired by gotto's excellent work. Thanks! (http://gotto.jp/blog/entries/012)

Usage:
 1. Write your mixin in a special comment on your stylesheet. 
    Special comment part starts with "/****{mixc}" and ends with "****/".
    
    /****{mixc}
    .main-content {
        // You can use single-line comment
        .grid_9;
        .boxed;
    }
    .sidebar {
        .grid_3;
        .boxed;
    }
    ****/
 
 2. Attach a suffix ".mixc.css" to stylesheet and save it.

 3. Link your ".mixc.css" stylesheets.
 
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/style.mixc.css"/>
    
 4. Include jQuery and mixc-min.js in the <head> element of your page.
 
    <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="mixc-min.js"></script>

    Make sure you include your stylesheets before the script.
